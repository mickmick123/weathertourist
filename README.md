## About Weather Tourist

This project aims to provide full city and weather information for tourists that have plans to visit Japan.
UI/UX of this project is based to dark theme to give the user a more dashing experience and easy to read text.

This project is based on Laravel 8 and Vuejs using a single page application that has a huge impact when it comes to dynamic page loading.

## About SPA

A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server, instead of the default method of the browser loading entire new pages. The goal is faster transitions that make the website feel more like a native app.

In a SPA, all necessary HTML, JavaScript, and CSS code is either retrieved by the browser with a single page load,[1] or the appropriate resources are dynamically loaded and added to the page as necessary, usually in response to user actions. The page does not reload at any point in the process, nor does it transfer control to another page, although the location hash or the HTML5 History API can be used to provide the perception and navigability of separate logical pages in the application.
